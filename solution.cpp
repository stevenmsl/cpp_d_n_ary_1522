/* takeaways
   - the longest paths
     - they are from a leave node to another
       leave node
     - or leave node to root
       (if root has only one child)

   - visiting a node to find the top 1
     and top 2 paths in length
     - it's better to draw a tree to
       understand this
             /
             2
          / / \ \
         3 4  5  6
     - the possible paths are 3-2-4, 4-2-5, ...
     - from 2's point, the longest path is formed
       from the top two of the child paths in length
       plus itself

   - here is the trciky part
     - a node's children might alread can form the longest
       and move up the tree to include node won't help
     - check the example 2 in the question
       - once you done visiting the node 2, you move up to node
         node 1 and report the top 1 length "2" back along the
         way
       - the maxLength so far is 4
       - node 1 only has 1 child, so the top 1 for it
         is 2 (reports back by node 2) plus 1 as you traveled
         up one more. Top 2 for node 1 is 0
       - so if path formed including node 1 can only have
         a length of 3 ( 3 + 0)
       - so node 1 is not included
